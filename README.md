# SC2 Bot Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts designed to automate gameplay tasks in StarCraft II. These scripts implement various strategies and tactics for AI bots within the game. These are my first attemps at SC2 bots and none of them are by any means a polished, finished project.

## Repository Contents

- `botDemo.py` - A demonstration script showcasing the basic functionalities of SC2 AI.
- `protoss_bot.py` - A bot script designed for managing Protoss unit strategies.
- `sc2bot.py` - The core script that contains common functionalities for SC2 AI.
- `sc2_bot_notes.txt` - A file containing notes and documentation relevant to the bot development.
- `workerRushBot.py` - A script that implements the 'worker rush' strategy, an early-game tactic.
- `zealot_charge_bot.py` - A script focusing on the use of Zealot units with Charge ability for aggressive plays.

## Getting Started

To use these bots, you will need to install StarCraft II and set up the Python SC2 API. Make sure Python 3.x is installed on your system and all the required dependencies are installed, which you can find listed in a `requirements.txt` file in this repository.

## Usage

To run a bot, execute the corresponding Python script from the command line:

```bash
python botDemo.py
```
